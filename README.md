# FEHD_omp
FEHD written in openmp (c++)

The FEHD algorithm written for cpus. If you have an nvidia gpu, I would recommend
FEHD cuda. It is much faster. I also feel more comfortable pegging my gpu at 100%
overnight than I do with my cpu. The program uses a lot of memory, you might want
to avoid using it on a mac. I don't have access to an M* mac, so this is
speculation.
